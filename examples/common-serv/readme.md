```

npm install express
node server.js

```



if you need ssl,  selfsigned can be used
```

npm install selfsigned
SSL=true node server.js

```


this example uses requirejs to fetch and load like require in browser

this will help gun development by serving a unbuilt version that can be 
refreshed after editing src without building gun for browser side
