What is this
------------

These Shows off how gun and other components can be used with requires. 
It uses requires to fetch and load like require in browser.
This will allow developers that load the gun src instead of the built/bundle code
So you can refresh after editing src without building gun for browser side


setup
-----

```

npm install express
node server.js

```


if you need ssl,  selfsigned can be used
```

npm install selfsigned
SSL=true node server.js

```
